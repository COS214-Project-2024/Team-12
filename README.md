Overview
The City Simulation Project is designed to provide an interactive experience where users can build, manage, and simulate a city. Key aspects like tax collection, utilities management, citizen happiness, and economic growth are implemented, allowing users to observe how different actions impact the cityâ€™s overall well-being.

The software applies three main design patterns: Singleton, Observer, and State. These patterns support complex interactions within the city, ensuring that changes propagate seamlessly and that citizens react to the city's changing conditions.

Features
City Building and Management: Add and manage residential, commercial, and public service buildings.
Utility System: Connect water, power, sewage, and waste management utilities to various zones and buildings.
Dynamic Citizen Reactions: Citizens react to changes in utilities, policies, and overall city environment.
Economic System: Manage tax collection, resource processing, and citizen-driven donations based on their happiness level.
